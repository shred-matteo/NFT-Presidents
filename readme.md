Hello! Here is the link of the video-walkthrough:



The Script uses Python dependencies that are installed with pip. 

Link For Python:

PIP is python package installer used for dependencies:

library to generate images - Pillow

Generate DeadPrez is based on NFT-Bird project. 

This code is not perfect and im more then open to suggestions! I can be reached at shred.matteo@gmail.com ! 

Just run "__main__.py" and default value will generate 10 dead_prezidents. 
Changing the "ic" (iteration count) value will change the number of presidents that are produced

"transform_scripts.py" is where you can go to mess with the transformations, adjust the variables and change
the images that are being inserted into it. ALL images are same size 480 x 480 to avoid clipping.

This version on github is just a demo version, to show how the code works and allow for others to build upon it and create even more
amazing projects! I hope that this can help someone else improve their coding, and i hope that someone else can help me improve mine! :)

There isn't much code to adjust once you have everything set! I spent a lot of time adjusting the photos and making sure that the layers would 
add on top of each other cleanly. 

I recommend using Gimp, its a Free photo manipulation software.
